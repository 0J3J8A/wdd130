        <img src="images/simonbolivar.jpg" alt="PARK_SIMON_BOLIVAR_BOGOTA">
        <p>Bogotá is the capital of Colombia, located in the mountains. It's a big city with a mix of old and new
            buildings. One of its coolest spots is Simón Bolívar Park, a huge park where people can walk, relax, and
            enjoy nature. It's a great place to escape the busy city and have fun with friends or family. Normally,
            people visit the park on weekends and public holidays, and the best part is that the entrance is free.</p>
